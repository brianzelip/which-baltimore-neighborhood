### Updated

### Performance result

This decreased the netlify-served js bundle from 2.46kb transferred to 2.30kb transferred ðŸŽ‰

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-20

- branch: master
- description: experiment on js bundle delivery

### Added

- parcel as dev-dependency
- d3-polygon as dependency

### Updated

- index.html: Removed the d3-polygon import
- main.js: Import d3-polygon
- .gitignore: Ignore Parcel output

### Experimentation 1 results

- local serving via http-server of the v0.3.0 js bundles:

  - d3-polygon: 1.33kb transferred
  - main.js: 1.85kb transferred

- w/ parcel that only bundles main.js

  - d3-polygon: 1.33kb transferred
  - main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 2.20kb transferred

- w/ parcel that bundles both d3-polygon and main.js
  - main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 5.71kb transferred

### Experimentation 1 analysis

Fuck parcel in this case! I find it so wack that introducing parcel nearly doubles the size of the bundle, even if it decreases the js bundle downloads from 2 to 1.

Here's another question: which is worse, 2 download bundles, each < 2kb, or 1 download bundle of 5.71kb?

Let's experiment!

### Experimentation 2 results

- 2 js bundle downloads, served via http-server, @ v0.3.0 state

  - d3-polygon: 1.33kb transferred, 32ms, 147ms, 27ms, 84ms, 136ms
  - main.js: 1.85kb transferred, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms

- 1 js bundle download, served via http-server, via parcel build

  - main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 5.71kb transferred, 1ms, 2ms, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms

### Experimentation 2 analysis

The comparison of the two approaches is:

- the parcel route which yields a 5.71kb transferred bundle size, but only 1 bundle download, in only 1ms
- the index.html route which yields a 3.18kb transferred bundle size, but with 2 bundle downloads, in an average total time of 85ms

I'm inclined to decide not to use parcel, for the sake of prioritizing overall file size download on mobile over the matter of milliseconds that is at stake here.

However, I also want to use postcss in order to use autoprefixer for my future css work. Then there is also the future service worker implementation, which will be another js bundle. So perhaps I should go with parcel.
