## [v0.9.0] 2019-11-25

- branch: topography-bg
- description: Add a svg background to the body via [Hero Patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/)
  - use the Topography pattern, adapted for my design
  - dynamically set the svg's fill color based on app theme

## [v0.8.0] 2019-11-23

- branch: inline-css
- description:
  - refactor the css from inlined in the source index.html to an external css file to be inlined into the built index.html. This was spawned because I didn't like html being the project's main language as depicted via github. The reason the html file is so large is because of the css. So extracting it out to its own file will change that. For perf reasons, I'm going to inline the css into the built index.html file that is served via netlify.
  - the effect of using this inliner plugin also inlines the JS, so that the app is wholy contained in the built index.html file. I'll have to compare the fully served netlify files (ie: the state of bmore.space after merging this branch with master) to get the real numbers for before/after comparison

### Perf comparison analysis

This analysis was committed after bumping the version to v0.8.0.

#### Before inlining external css and js

- index.html: 1.88kb transferred, 37ms
- main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 2.54kb transferred, 85ms

total: 4.42kb transferred, ~122ms

#### After inlining external css and js

- index.html: 3.94kb transferred, 39ms

total: 3.94kb transferred, ~39ms

#### Results

Inlining external css and js FTW ðŸŽ‰

By the way - now GitHub lists css as the main language associated with the project :)

### Added

- dev dependency: [parcel-plugin-inliner](https://github.com/shff/parcel-plugin-inliner)
- css/hood.css: copy css from index.html

### Updated

- index.html: remove css, link to hood.css
- package.json: add `--public-url .` to build script via the inliner plugin docs:

> Very important!
>
> You have to run the build step in Parcel with the --public-url . option for the inliner to actually find the files. If you leave this out the default is /, and the inliner won't be able to look for the files in the right location.
>
> Example:
>
> `parcel build app/index.html --public-url .`

### Removed

## [0.4.1] - 2019-11-21

- branch: d3
- description: Import only `polygonContains` from d3-polygon to decrease bundle size

### Updated

- main.js: Refactor import and usage of d3-polygon

### Performance result

This decreased the netlify-served js bundle from 2.46kb transferred to 2.30kb transferred ðŸŽ‰

## [0.4.0] - 2019-11-20

- branch: master
- description: experiment on js bundle delivery

### Added

- parcel as dev-dependency
- d3-polygon as dependency

### Updated

- index.html: Removed the d3-polygon import
- main.js: Import d3-polygon
- .gitignore: Ignore Parcel output

### Experimentation 1 results

- local serving via http-server of the v0.3.0 js bundles:

  - d3-polygon: 1.33kb transferred
  - main.js: 1.85kb transferred

- w/ parcel that only bundles main.js

  - d3-polygon: 1.33kb transferred
  - main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 2.20kb transferred

- w/ parcel that bundles both d3-polygon and main.js
  - main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 5.71kb transferred

### Experimentation 1 analysis

Fuck parcel in this case! I find it so wack that introducing parcel nearly doubles the size of the bundle, even if it decreases the js bundle downloads from 2 to 1.

Here's another question: which is worse, 2 download bundles, each < 2kb, or 1 download bundle of 5.71kb?

Let's experiment!

### Experimentation 2 results

- 2 js bundle downloads, served via http-server, @ v0.3.0 state

  - d3-polygon: 1.33kb transferred, 32ms, 147ms, 27ms, 84ms, 136ms
  - main.js: 1.85kb transferred, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms

- 1 js bundle download, served via http-server, via parcel build

  - main.{PARCEL STRING}.js: 5.71kb transferred, 1ms, 2ms, 1ms, 1ms, 1ms

### Experimentation 2 analysis

The comparison of the two approaches is:

- the parcel route which yields a 5.71kb transferred bundle size, but only 1 bundle download, in only 1ms
- the index.html route which yields a 3.18kb transferred bundle size, but with 2 bundle downloads, in an average total time of 85ms

I'm inclined to decide not to use parcel, for the sake of prioritizing overall file size download on mobile over the matter of milliseconds that is at stake here.

However, I also want to use postcss in order to use autoprefixer for my future css work. Then there is also the future service worker implementation, which will be another js bundle. So perhaps I should go with parcel.
